## Preamble  

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation,
use the GNU GPL for most of our software; it applies also to many
other kinds of works, in particular to libraries.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
need it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom
of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two
steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this
license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

For the developers' and users' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the software is
defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or
correction.  This disclaimer of warranty is required by law in many
countries, so that the software is provided «as is».

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  

#### 0. Definitions.

This License refers to version 2 of the GNU GPL (the "License").

**"This License"** means the GNU GPL version 2 as published by the
Free Software Foundation.

**"Copyright"** means any and all copyrightable works.

**"The Program"** means any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you."

**"You"** (or "your") means an individual or a legal entity exercising
rights under this License.  

**"Source"** form refers to the preferred form of the work for making
modifications.  

**"Object code"** form refers to any non‑source form of a work.

**"Standard Interface"** means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces that are not a standard, has become a de‑facto standard,
through common usage, with `public` documentation (such as a
published specification).

**"System Libraries"** are the libraries and support files that are
included in a standard distribution of the operating system on which a
program runs, and are required for the program to function.

**"Corresponding Source"** means all the source code needed to generate,
install, and (for executable works) run the object code and to modify
the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However,
it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose
tools or public domain works.

**"Work"** means the Program or any derivative work under this
License, or any compilation which contains the Program or a derivative
of the Program.

**"Derivative Work"** means a work that contains the Program or any
portions of it, and which is protected by copyright, as well as is
derived from the Program.

**"Contribution"** means any work of authorship, including the original
program, regarding which a copyright is claimed by the contributor,
makes available under this License.

#### 1. Source Code.

The program must be accompanied by the complete corresponding source
code.  

The source code must be made available under the same conditions as
the object code.

#### 2. Basic Permissions.

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code, provided that you keep the copyright notices and none of the
license terms are altered.

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
thereof, and distribute such modifications under this License,
provided that you meet the conditions in Sections 3 and 4.

#### 3. Redistribution.

You may redistribute the Program in either source or object code
form, as long as you meet the following conditions:

1. You must give any other recipients a copy of this License
   together with the Program.

2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
   stating that you changed them, and the date of any change.

3. The entire work must be licensed as a whole at no charge to all
   third parties under this License.

#### 4. Modification and Derivative Works.

If you modify the Program, you may distribute the resulting work
under the terms of this License, **provided that**:

* The modified work carries prominent notices stating that you
  changed it and the date of any change.

* You license the entire work as a whole, at no charge to any third
  party, under the terms of this License.

* If the work contains any other software that is not covered by
  this License, you must meet the licensing requirements of that
  software.

#### 5. Combined Works.

You may combine the Program with other programs or libraries, provided
that the combined work complies with the requirements of this License
for the Program component.

#### 6. No Warranty.

**EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW**, THE PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

#### 7. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF DATA OR PROFITS, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLE
SCOPE OF SUCH DAMAGES.

#### 8. Acceptance.

By using, modifying, or distributing the Program, you indicate your
acceptance of the terms and conditions of this License.

#### 9. How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs.

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; each file should also contain a
copyright notice:

```
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year>  <your name>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA
```

Also add the following footnote that addresses the Non‑Warranty clause
and the license version you are releasing under:

```
[This program is licensed under the GNU GPL v2, or (at your option)
any later version.  See the file LICENSE or the URL
